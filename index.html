    <p>Qulia Brunson is a 36 year old wife and mom of two. Before becoming either of these titles she was a daughter and sister to two brothers. As a young child she grew up in Charlotte, NC with her parents and brothers. Her favorite hobbies were playing with dolls and cheerleading. Early in life she knew she would become successful because she had always been great academically.</p>
    <h2 id="my-start">How I Got My Start</h2>
    <p>As I mentioned before I knew I would be successful in life because I always earned good grades and academic achievement awards. I was never the top of my class but I did graduate with honors. In middle school, we were required to take computer classes. This was my favorite period of the day because computers intrigued me. Around that time Myspace was new also. Myspace was a social network that required coding to create your profile page. I remembering having joy from creating a new profile page every week for myself and my friends. It was something rewarding about seeing my visions coming to life on the screen.</p>
    <p>I was recently introduced to Grand Circus through Dexian. Dexian is a company that I have formerly worked with and when I saw the opportunity for this bootcamp it was right on time. I recently considered applying to a few jobs in the tech industry but doubted my ability. This bootcamp with Grand Circus will give me the confidence to not only apply to tech jobs but to master the skills necessary to become great in this career field and beyond.</p>
